This site exists to provide more transparency for the OpenHatch organization.

Right now, there is a for-profit corporation that is closing down. As discussed at [this blog post](https://openhatch.org/blog/2011/openhatch-gains-full-time-project-lead-transitioning-into-a-non-profit/), Asheesh Laroia is working on OpenHatch "full-time" and we are creating a non-profit.

For the moment, this site will contain a "Captain's Log": a blog of daily, quite-short updates by Asheesh on what happened in a day. They're quite informal.

Eventually I expect to publish OpenHatch's corporate documents here.

## Accounting

We keep our accounting data in git. Access information:

First, get the git repo:

    git clone git@vm3.openhatch.org:oh-accounting.git

Then, 'cd' in and get the ledger balance:

    cd oh-accounting
    cd ledger-data
    ledger -f 2012 bal --strict

Possible problem:

* *Don't have ledger installed?* apt-get install ledger, or install it from its own git repo
* *Don't have permission to do the git-clone?* Talk to Asheesh, and get him to add your SSH key.
