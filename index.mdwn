This site exists to provide more transparency for the OpenHatch organization.

Right now, there is a for-profit corporation that is closing down. As discussed at [this blog post](https://openhatch.org/blog/2011/openhatch-gains-full-time-project-lead-transitioning-into-a-non-profit/), Asheesh Laroia is working on OpenHatch "full-time" and we are creating a non-profit.

For the moment, this site will contain a "Captain's Log": a blog of daily, quite-short updates by Asheesh on what happened in a day. They're quite informal.

Eventually I expect to put more corporate documents here.
