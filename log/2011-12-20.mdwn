Captain's log, December 20, 2011

(Note: I'm in San Francisco until Thursday, then on-and-off next week.)

(The following took place Monday, Dec 19:)

* Spent 2 hours in the Wikimedia Foundation office talking excitedly with two of their tech staff about possible collaborations.
** I took notes and will send a note to OH-Board with more details.
* Planned meetings with other people in SF who might be helpful or interesting to talk with.
* Fixed an out-of-disk-space condition (cause: Roundup's log was 2.3 gigabytes). 

(The following took place Tue, Dec 20:)

* Discussed site reliability with Karen Rustad
* Spent a few hours adjusting /search/ to be speedier. Particularly, now it does not generate suggested searches. This can be re-enabled with a settings.py option. It is still not quite fast enough.
* Discussed the history of OpenHatch with an old friend, Ben Lowenstein, who is now working on a web-based language learning project.
* Discussed fundraising with Allison formerly of CC's fundraising team.
