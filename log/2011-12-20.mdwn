Captain's log, December 20, 2011

(Note: I'm in San Francisco until Thursday, then on-and-off next week.)

* Spent 2 hours in the Wikimedia Foundation office talking excitedly with two of their tech staff about possible collaborations.
** I took notes and will send a note to OH-Board with more details.
* Planned meetings with other people in SF who might be helpful or interesting to talk with.
* Fixed an out-of-disk-space condition (cause: Roundup's log was 2.3 gigabytes).
