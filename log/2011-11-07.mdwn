Captain's log, supplemental

Over the weekend:

* I spent a lot of time on writing and choosing bylaws and articles of incorporation.
* I spent a lot of time discussing non-profit boards with Mike Linksvayer. It was a great conversation.
* I aim to deliver all this to our lawyer Tuesday and then we can iterate with him.

Today:

* Woke up later than I wanted to.
* Reviewed a patch by viv in the tracker.
* Reviewed (at length) Jessica McKellar's suggested changes for bostonpythonworkshop.com and planned blog post for pyfound
* Added a note of deprecation to the old bugtracker import code, and removed most references to it.
* Spent some time writing up notes for how people can help, before the Project Night. This should come in handy for later wannabe-contributor roundups.
* At Python Project Night, I worked a few people through getting OH dev setups ready. It was, basically, a tragic flop. But I learned that 1) it sucks still, and 2) it can be fixed (if we use more pure-Python dependencies, and gracefully give error messages when things won't work (rather than make sure that buildout makes sure everything will work).
