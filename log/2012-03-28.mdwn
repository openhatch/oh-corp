Captain's log, Wednesday March 28

* Looked at logs from today's backup to see that it is properly working
* Configured it to keep the last 4 weeks' backups, rather than 2, since 4 will fit
* Began to more seriously plan costs, travel, speakers etc. for RPI Open Source Comes to Campus
* Reminded OH-Board that hello@ exists and asked if anyone wants to be on it
* Reviewed Greg Grossmeier's first OH-Publicity blog post, w/r/t PyCon sprints
* Pinged jesstess to see if she's interested in writing text about BPW branding for OH-Events
* Traded emails with Mozilla University Recruiting division about working with us on some campus.openhatch.org events, and discovered I have to make some new friends there (:
* Looked into + discussed with Karen the status of current T-shirt order, and identified next steps for finishing distributing this round of T-shirt orders
* Discovered the wiki is *still* acting up, and that setting its user ID in php5-fpm to www-data makes it act normal again. Sad, but that's just how it'll be. I'm quite looking forward to the wiki not giving the infamous "Loss of session data" problem again.

On a more personal note:

* Helped freedeb get set up with an IRC bouncer so she can read more IRC (:
* Bought a new laptop battery so that my laptop does not simply turn *off* when I disconnect it from power (:
