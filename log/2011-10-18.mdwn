Captain's log, stardate 1110.18

* Pinged our non-profit lawyer for an update about what our next steps are on his end.
* Talked briefly with a friend who thought there was a possible funding lead, but it turns out the organization was looking for groups that are connected directly with K12 education.
* Talked non-briefly with Elizabeth Stark about how she thinks the non-profit structure is a hindrance to what we are doing, and also about how there are lots of low-quality, well-funded online education startups. I talked about how I don't really like the startup model, but she asked me to reconsider. In this I learned that she thought Boston Python Workshop and PyStar were the same effort, whereas in fact they have different perspectives on community involvement and have different visible people (AKA organizers).
* I reread the new proposed Boston Python Workshop site with an eye toward, What would a newcomer learn from this (and what would they fail to notice)? Wrote some notes on paper; will implement tomorrow.
* I invited Greg Price to join the Events list. I hope he says yes.
* I joined the HCS-Discuss list where, with the blessing of their Outreach person, I am permitted to send updates about open source outreach-related events.
* Fixed a bug with the OpenHatch blog where https://openhatch.org/blog would send you to http://localhost/blog/ uselessly.
* Spent a long time considering strategy and writing emails on a thread with the Python Software Foundation board about funding some more Boston Python Workshop events. Jessica McKellar started the thread, and I invited David Mertz to give us strategy advice, which I believe will prove helpful.
