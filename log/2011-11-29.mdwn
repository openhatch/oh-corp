Captain's Log, November 29, 2011

* Wrote a draft letter of recommendation to submit to a Penn faculty member who might write us a recommendation for it (which took quite a while)
* Discussed the the Open Source Comes to Campus event series with our Penn letter-of-recommendation writer, and got her to a yes (-:
* Removed a lot of text from the grant document to fit within the 3 page limit, and created Google Docs for those as required
* Submitted a check for downstream (e.g. IRS) fees to our lawyer (which I asked him to account for, fully, in our final billing)
