Captain's log, January 4, 2012

* Had lunch with Deb.
* Worked for a bunch of hours (way too many, probably) on moving the location data out of profile.Person into a new model, profile.Location. Probably another 2-4 hours and it'll be done.
* Came up with some good probable micro-optimizations for the location data API view
* Discovered that, fundamentally, the location data API view should use one (maybe two) database queries, and if we can do that, we can make it load very fast.
* Fixed some bugs in mysite.customs.* which are discovered by Hudson because has lxml installed now.
* Reviewed Jessica's post inviting first-time poster submitters to submit to PyCon.
* Asked the planet.python.org maintainers to add our blog's 'python' tag feed.
* Asked Sarah+Sarah of Railsbridge to give a poster at PyCon (-:
* Drafted (not yet sent) an email to OH-Dev asking for help on how to make the JSON data export for /people/ snappier.
* Drafted (not yet sent) an email to OH-Dev asking for style guidance w/r/t controllers.py vs. helpers.py, etc.
* Installed python-openssl on linode2, in preparation for moving customs_twist to it.
