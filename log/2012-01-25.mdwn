Captain's log, January 25, 2012

* Sent some quick notes to OH-Publicity: Requesting a monthly newsletter, and listing the two LibrePlanet proposals I submitted.
* Moved inside.openhatch.org off linode.openhatch.org (onto linode2). This saves a bunch of (precious) disk space.
* Asked rsync.net if they'd donate free backup storage for us.
* Asked GPLHost if they'd donate a VM for us.
* Fixed Google Analytics on openhatch.org. (The problem was that a few weeks ago I accidentally deleted deployment_settings_secret_keys.py, which contained our Google Analytics code. Now that string lives in the public repo.
* Send email to PyCon booth organizer to find out more about what a sponsor booth entails.
* Had lunch with Karen Rustad; discussed T-shirts, sponsor booths, and UMD OpenHatch Comes to Campus event.
* Had dinner with Mike Linksvayer; discussed other possible funders.
