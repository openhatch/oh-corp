Captain's log, supplemental

* Wrote a belated captain's log post for yesterday
* Emailed meetings from my meeting with jesstess last night to Events list
* Redesigned the proposed BPW site, which was a very interesting learning experience (in a positive way) about CSS
* Half-done with changes requested by jesstess on BPW site, content-wise
* Got a "pong" from our corporate lawyer, who has some questions I'll have to answer once he prepares them for me toward the end of the week
* Emailed the outreach-and-education committee and got some more positive feedback. I guess we'll do voting tomorrow.
