Captain's log, 2011-12-09

Today I:

* Read and reflected on the Ada Initiative's montly chat's IRC logs
* Asked John Sullivan for contact info for a good Emacs hacker in the SF Bay Area who might be a great contact for our GNU hackathon
* Discussed incorporation status (status: incorporated!) with Jonas
* Created a draft reblog about the pyfound blog post about the Boston Python Workshop
* Suggested that bpw-staff people have a smaller, earlier get-together to review the curriculum
* Checked on travel reimbursement from KDE e.V. for the Desktop Summit
* Talked more with Jordan at OSL about hosting our snapshots

Also I find myself in Philadelphia.
