Captain's log for Tuesday, November 15, 2011

* Explored the P2PU website, and created the curriculum for the course
* Fixed our automatic tester (Hudson) so it runs the tests the new (manage.py) way
* Fixed some server cron jobs that were sending me (every 10 min) DeprecationWarnings
* Had the chance to talk with glyph some more about why people are confused about Twisted.
