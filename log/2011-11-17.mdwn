Captain's Log, November 17

* Spent lots of time fixing a low-disk-space condition on the main OpenHatch site (kudos to Jessica for noticing the site was down).
* Removed old "memlogs" system that checked which process(es) were using up the most RAM every 5 minutes
* Fixed the bug tracker and Postfix repeatedly until both were actually happy
* Wrote a brief introduction to the P2PU course on the course page
* Mentored Jilly on IRC with regard to how the new bugimporters (vs. bugtrackers) system works
* Discovered that I did not understand how "Moderated Signups" work on P2PU, which led me to delay publicizing the course
