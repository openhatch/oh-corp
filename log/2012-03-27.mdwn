Captain's log, Mon through Tue, March 26-27, 2012

Monday March 26:

* Was interviewed by Christina Dunbar-Hester, Assistant Professor of Journalism & Media Studies at Rutgers, about feminism and free software.
* Asked greg-g to write a PyCon sprints follow-up blog post (:
* Began scheduling a time with Deb to visit BoA and give her access to the bank acct
* Reviewed last week's goals, and concluded there is a lot more work to do on those
* Created a virtual machine on xvm.mit.edu to test OpenHatch backups

Tuesday March 27:

* Pinged Karen about T-shirt next steps
* Automated 3/4 of the process required for automatic testing of backups
* Configured our nightly backup job to remove old, stale backups
* Configured our nightly backup job to remove all but 2 weeks of backups (so we stop filling up our quota)
* Fixed oh-bugimporters and moved stale bug count from 100% to 37%
* Discussed on OH-Dev what needs to be done for the missions documentation to get written
* Spent morning chatting with Michael Stone about his recent email to Peers about learning styles. Particular touchpoints for OpenHatch:
** When people sign up, we could tell them we want to know about their learning style.
** The front page could use testimonials.
** We/I could write a blog post about how the amazingly-successful BPW is just the latest in a long slew of mostly-unsuccessful Python teaching attempts from me. This one is successful, though, and that's because I kept trying.
