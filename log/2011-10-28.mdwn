Captain's log, supplemental

In a local branch, I'm working on improving the bug import code:
* Fixed a number of crashes in the bug import code
* I removed my old Bug.bug_tracker attribute and am trying to normalize toward Bug.tracker ala pythonian4000
* Contributed a bit to the OH-Dev discussion of the new, extracted bug importers

Generally:

* Monitored voting process for BPW grant; pinged one committee to make sure he/she puts in a vote
