Captain's Log, January 26, 2012

* Configured and ran backups for the OpenHatch linode on rsync.net because they said "Yes" to donating us space.
* Discussed T-shirt designs with Karen on IRC.
* Wrote yesterday's captain's log, oops.
* Pinged Jen Lindner of Railsbridge, via Twitter, to see if she'll write about Boston Python Workshop
* Pinged Mike Linksvayer further w/r/t good people to network with
* Received PyCon booth email; will have to figure out what to do with it.
* Created a VM at GPLHost, which will be where we move some things (Hudson, probably).
