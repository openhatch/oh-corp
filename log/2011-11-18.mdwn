* Discussed Ada Initiative chat with Jessica McKellar
* Emailed the P2PU-dev list about the confusing Moderated Signup issue, after spending a while reading the source code to Lernanta and not quite understanding the problem
* Discussed with Jessica which cities would be good outreach targets for the grant we got from PSF
* (Attempted to?) Move GNOME Bugzilla into the new bugimporters framework
