Captain's log, February 6, 2012

* Met with Karen and discussed how to be more efficient and ways to better-set priorities for the org. I have written notes from the meeting, which I'll send out to OH-Board.
* Researched and planned travel and other concerns for the UMD campus event. Sent an email with those details to the relevant parties.
