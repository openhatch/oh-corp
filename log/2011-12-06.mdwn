* Emailed OH-Dev about the most recent sprint
* Adjusted pythonsprints.com blog post so that the image references for the recent OpenHatch sprint don't point to my personal server
* Suggested some website changes for the Boston Python Workshop site that give more of a sense of freshness
* Traded brief emails with FSF about a possible GNU and/or Emacs hackathon
* Finished a draft of the Saturday curriculum "Open Source to Campus"
