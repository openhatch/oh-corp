Captain's log, supplemental

This log covers the first week of November, up to
and including Thursday, November 3.

I was traveling and didn't get as much work done as I expected.
Some things that did happen.

Weekend, plus Monday, October 31:

* Made lots of changes to the bug import code to support custom bug parser code.
* Pushed this and got some feedback from Jack Grigg.

Tuesday, November 1:

* Discussed PyStar+BPW collaboration with Jessica McKellar.

Wednesday, November 2:

* Met with Jackie of PyLadies DC and got a sense of what the group is like. They are planning to run a BPW-esque event in mid-January at the earliest. I learned a lot about libraries from Jackie, and she was patient with me as I nailed down the rest of my travel schedule. I talked at length about BPW and what makes it successful. She wondered what would happen if companies request smaller, private BPW-esque workshops.

Thursday, November 3:

* Made lots of changes to the bug import code to make it more testable.
* Officially delayed the 0.11.10 release until Sun Nov 6.
