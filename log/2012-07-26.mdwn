Captain's log, Thu July 26

* Continued to trudge through Qualtrics UI to get Hackathon exit survey tested and set up
* Created a Wikimedia Research page about the exit survey, to be extra kosher
* (Published Wed's captain's log)
* Sent thread to wikitech-l discussing what should become of the Hackathon Laptop Setup guide.
* Reviewed and pushed soonick5's patch, finally!
* Discussed WMF events stuff with Shauna, and Sumana. Did lots of follow-up tasks from that.
* Did a lot of emailing to make sure we're on good ground for invoicing WMF. (We are.)
