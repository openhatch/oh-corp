Captain's Log, Jan 5, 2012

* After a few false starts, made the JSON API generation for /people/ much faster. Sent a note to OH-Dev about how.
** Another 10-100x improvement is probably possible.
* Spent some time in the morning fixing an Error 500 on the blog by restarting /etc/init.d/php5-fpm and also adding 5-min monitoring for the blog through pingdom.com.
