Captain's log, November 8, 2011

* I tagged and released 0.11.10. I also got a chance to try the "git flow" tool.
* I believe I am done working through IRS and corporate paperwork. I submitted our form 1023 questionnaire to our lawyer, as well as our articles of incorporation and bylaws. The only thing left to decide is how often (and when) we meet.
* Board members have agreed to be on the board, and I sent an introductory email to it.
* I briefly helped someone (who I met yesterday at Project Night) find a good python.org bug to wokr on.
* Woke up at a reasonable time, which I enjoyed greatly.
