Captain's log, 2011-11-28

Today, I:

* Wrote a bunch of text for a grant proposal for Google RISE and submitted it to OH-Board for review from mostly Jessica
* Also submitted the same text to a friend from the non-profit fundraising world to see if she has any feedback
* Asked for a letter of recommendation from someone at Penn, which she agreed to
* Applied for an EIN from the IRS for the non-profit OpenHatch
* Send a short note to the Board with a progress report of our non-profit corporation formation
* Re-sent Clover reimbursements to the PSF Sprint folks, which they ACK'd
* Submitted the Sprint Report, which should get posted on the PSF Sprints blog
