Captain's log, supplemental

* Finished (to 1.0 level) Boston Python Workshop website. I'm very happy with it!
* Began the voting for PSF grant for Boston Python Workshop.
* Spoke with Shannon at length about OH front page redesign and Boston Python Workshop site. Got some great feedback (it's on paper at the moment).
