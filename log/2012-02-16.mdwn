* Spent most of the day working with Karen on the redesign. Much progress made. Mostly worked on the new /guide/ page that explains the site to project maintainers.
* Discussed A/B testing with willkg, and got design feedback.
* Began to look into how to test the backups. Concluded that it we should start by trying user-mode-linux to boot a filesystem snapshot. Began installing that on vm3.openhatch.org.
* Discussed Heroku-ification with armooo. Got a patch that will take serious thought.
