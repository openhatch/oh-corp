Captain's log, Dec 1 2011

* Emailed the OH-Dev list with a plan for the sprint
* Officially delayed the release
* Removed mysite/customs/bugtrackers/* except launchpad
* Added many more bug trackers to the web UI
* Removed lots of spam accounts and all their data, and wrote some simple but extremely useful tools to help do that
* Added a code syntax highlighting extension to the wiki
* Fixed wiki image uploads (some things were owned by www-data that should have been owned by "wiki")
