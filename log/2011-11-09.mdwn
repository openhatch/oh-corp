Captain's Log, 2011-11-09

* Worked from the Media Lab, which was nice.
* Spent a substantial amount of time crushing INBOX down to 29 messages, which was thrilling.
* In the process, found some accounts that wanted to be deleted, closed the loop, and did so.
* Adjusted the default settings in the OpenHatch code to use sqlite3 instead of MySQL by default.
* Decided that dev environment setup process is too absurdly arduous and that it can be dramatically simpler.
* Spent some time discussing the "vendor"-directory strategy with Will Kahn-Greene, and decided to use that instead of buildout or virtualenv.
* Spent some time helping prospective contributors get dev environments set up. Part of this involved shipping the sqlite-ification.
* Updated all the bugs with the 0.11.10 milestone tag.
* Polled the mailing list and IRC visitors on a time this weekend for an OpenHatch sprint.
