Captain's log, March 29, 2012

* Added Deb as a Bank of America co-signer, and got her a debit card
* Worked further on sending reminders + address requests to T-shirt non-payers
    * Found a nice Python mail template package, and will use that to send them, to save me time copying+editing templates.
* Reviewed and pushed latest doc improvements from mdaniel (which are quite exciting)
* Emailed a friend at Google OSPO to see if we can catch up
* Diagnosed and fixed further problems with the wiki not saving session data; this seems to be fixed now that I've made the following changes:
    * Store sessions in /var/lib/php5/sessions/ , not using subdirectories. This fixes a subtle problem where about 50-70% of the time, session data won't be stored (and errors aren't logged, grr)
    * Use file backend not memcache backend for session data (this probably increases the stability of storage of sessions)
    * Run the wiki as www-data, not "wiki" user ID
* Found on IRC + chatted with one Boston-area Twitter-using woman who is a fan of the Boston Python Workshop (:
