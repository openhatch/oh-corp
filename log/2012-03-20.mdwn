Captain's log, March 20, 2012

* Spent a whole bunch of time prepping a LibrePlanet presentation
* Went to a fundraiser for an event of a nonprofit a friend is the board; met someone whose cloud-y company might be interested in sponsoring us. We'll see
* Tried to send sponsors of silly sexist Boston API hackathon event information about OpenHatchy events
* Talked with one possible sponsor; it might not work out, but I might have helped them find a good person for their new organization's executive director position. Sent a follow-up note with a link to Open Source Comes to Campus curriculum.
* Sent sponsorship note to another group
* Sent an email to bkuhn with my notes about his fundraising advice
* Helped berryp learn about "git add -p", and will merge his pull requests tomorrow first thing.
* Noticed Daniel's pull requests on docs stuff; will review tomorrow.
