Captain's log, Wednesday, Feb 22, 2012

* Handled a brief email exchange on OH-Board.
* Discussed with the owner of an OpenHatch-y domain the possible transfer of that domain to OpenHatch.
* Created staff landing page for UMD event. Made some small edits (just location, I think) edits to attendee landing page created by Jessica McKellar.
* Invited a few more TAs.
* Further dealt with PayPal, which I seem to be succeeding at convincing that we are a legit organization.
