Captain's log, Mon July 23

* Began the paperwork process (documenting it partially here on corp.openhatch.org) to have the org hire me. (As background, last Tuesday's board meeting contained a decision to hire me, which is fantastic.)
* Wrote a draft of an exit survey for Wikimania Hackathon attendees.
* Processed some business cards and got in touch with people who I met at OSCON or in earlier travels.
* Emailed Hackers at Berkeley and JHU ACM about bringing a campus open source workshop there.
